# Database
This project uses a version of the Microsoft Access 2000 Northwind sample database, re-engineered for SQLite3.

The Northwind sample database was provided with Microsoft Access as a tutorial schema for managing small business customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, and employees. Northwind is an excellent tutorial schema for a small-business ERP, with customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, employees, and single-entry accounting.
